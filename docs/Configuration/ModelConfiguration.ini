; this file contains possible configuration parameters and their current defaults
; together with a short description of the purpose of each parameter

; IMPORTANT: it is not recommended to put this file 1:1 into the work folder because
;            default parameters can change over time and when they are provided with
;            this file the defaults get overridden

; to enable / change a certain parameter it needs to be uncommented
